Usage Python script to use the RPi to capture LEED images on command      
# The script interfaces with the RPi GPIO to provide
# two push buttons for control
# And two LED's for information on what is happeneing

# The script will intially light the green LED for 2 second,
# then the red LED for 2 secoonds
# ANd the will switch back to the green LED if it is ready to capture images.

# After a push button command to capture an image while
# the RPi is saving the file the red LED
# Will remain lit and it is ready to caputre again
# when the green LED comes back on

# The second button will immediately terminate the program

# If the LEDs remain on after terminatation then
# the script 'gclean.py' must be run
# This executes the GPIO.cleanup() function to
# free up valuable resources on the RPi

# ******* Note - this script must be run with admin privleges!!!
# If the script is run without admin privleges
# the GPIO will not be accessible

# To run cd to the directory of the script
# and execute 'sudo python picamleed.py'

This is a python script written to interface a Raspberry Pi and Pi Camera Board with an OMICRON SpectaLEED
system in order to collect data for LEED-IV experiments

This is a work in progress and can work independently of the IV analysis script pyLEED.py
This module only provides funtionality for data collection and does not accomplish any analysis
